## Introduction

Welcome to my Python training repository! I am using this repository to track my progress and showcase the materials and code examples I have covered during my Python learning journey. This training program aims to provide a solid foundation in Python programming and help me become proficient in Python development.

## Course Curriculum

The course curriculum follows the Python roadmap provided by [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/python). This roadmap outlines a step-by-step progression from beginner to advanced Python concepts and offers a visual representation of the skills I can develop. It covers a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

- Python syntax and data types
- Control flow and decision making
- Functions and modules
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- File handling and input/output operations
- Exception handling
- Generators and iterators
- Decorators and context managers
- Regular expressions
- Database integration with Python
- Web scraping and automation
- Testing and debugging
- Python libraries and frameworks

Please refer to the [Python roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/python) for a detailed breakdown of the topics covered.

## Getting Started

To get started with my Python training, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Install Python on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/). Make sure to install a version compatible with the code examples and exercises provided.

3. Set up a virtual environment (recommended) to manage your Python dependencies. Use the following command to create a virtual environment:

Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows: `myenv\Scripts\activate`
- On macOS/Linux: `source myenv/bin/activate`

4. Install the required dependencies. Run the following command in your activated virtual environment:

5. Explore the course curriculum and code examples provided in this repository. Each topic is organized in its corresponding directory, with relevant code files and documentation.

## Code Examples

The `practice` directory contains a collection of code snippets and examples corresponding to various topics covered in my training. You can explore these examples to understand different concepts and see Python code in action.

## Contributing

As this is my personal training repository, contributions are not expected. However, if you have any suggestions or feedback regarding the materials or code examples, feel free to share them.
